**Metrics Framework V1** provides a comprehensive and intuitive framework to evaluate the performance of any synthetic dataset vis-Ã -vis its original dataset and other synthetic datasets. It captures information on the tradeoff between general utility, specific utility and risk disclosure. 

**DCAP functions** provides functions to calculate the Correct Attribution Probabilbility (CAP) score as given by Taub, J., Elliot, M., Pampaka, M., &amp; Smith, D. (2018). Differential Correct Attribution Probability for Synthetic Data: An Exploration. Privacy in Statistical Databases Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 122-137. doi:10.1007/978-3-319-99771-1_9

**ROC compiled** provides functions to provide the Ratio of Counts (ROC) score as given by Taub, J., Elliot, M., & Raab, G. (2019). Creating the Best Risk-Utility Profile : The Synthetic Data Challenge.
